his Logstash configuration file parses antivirus log entries in a specific format, extracting key fields such as description, hostname, source_ip, and severity. Using the grok filter, it captures these fields and maps them to structured field names. The severity value, initially numeric, is converted to a human-readable text value (e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low") using the ruby filter. The output is then formatted as JSON, suitable for further processing or storage in a system like Elasticsearch. This configuration ensures that the logs are structured and easy to query for analysis and monitoring purposes.
